  <excerpt>What’s WiFi 6E?
Simply put, WiFi 6E means WiFi 6 extended to the 6 GHz band. WiFi 6E works with the same standard as WiFi 6 but with an extended spectrum. 6 GHz is the new frequency band ranging from 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz, allowing up to 1,200 MHz of additional spectrum. Unlike the existing bands on which channels are currently crammed into the limited spectrum, 6 GHz band exists without overlap or interference. Access to the 6 GHz frequency brings more bandwidth, faster speeds, and lower latency, opening up resources for future innovations like in AR/VR, 8K streaming and more.

*WiFi 6 is the next-gen standard in WiFi technology, also known as “AX WiFi” or “802.11ax WiFi”.</excerpt>
